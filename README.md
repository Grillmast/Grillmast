### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile. I am a student at the University of Denver, currently focused on server-side development as part of my pursuit of coding proficiency. I am working diligently to gain expertise in this field, and plan to expand my knowledge to include Python and Django in the near future.
